       <p> When we braid sweetgrass, we are braiding the hair of Mother Earth, showing her our loving attention, our care for her beauty and well-being, in gratitude for all she has given us. Children hearing the Skywoman story from birth know in their bones the responsibility that flows between humans and the earth. The story of Skywoman's journey is so rich and glittering it feels to me like a deep bowl of celestial blue from which I could drink again and again...perhaps the Skywoman stor endures because we to are always falling. Our lives, both personal and collective, share her trajectory. Whether we jump or are pushed, or the edge of the known world just crumbles at our feet, we fall, spinning into someplace new and unexpected. Despite our fears of falling, the gifts of the world stand by to catch us.</p>
    
    <p>The trees in a forest are often interconnected by subterranean networks of mycorrhizae, fungal strands that inhabit tree roots. The mycorrhizal symbiosis enables the fungi to forage for mineral nutrients in the soil and deliver them to the tree in exchange for carbohydrates. The mycorrhizae may form fungal bridges between individual trees, so that all the trees in a forest are connected. These fungal networks appear to redistribute the wealth of carbohydrates from tree to tree. A kind of Robin Hood, they take from the rich and give to the poor so that all the trees arrive at the same carbon surplus at the same time. They weave a web of reciprocity, of giving and taking. In this way, the trees all act as one because the fungi have connected them. Through unity, survival. All flourishing is mutual. Soil, fungus, tree, squirrel, boy-all are the beneficiaries of reciprocity.</p>

        <p>The book, Braiding Sweetgrass, by Robin Wall Kimmerer, is about the scientific knowledge and teachings of plants as well as the teachings of Indigenous knowledge and the overlaps between them. She begins the book with the orgins of Skywoman, who fell from the sky and created Earth. I really love the descriptive language she uses to describe Skywomans journey especially the phrase "deep bowl of celestial blue". There is a deep respect and appreciation for the natural world embedded in Skywomans story, and these same core beliefs are passed from one generation to the next. It's important to show the Earth gratitude, even for a single blade of grass because gratitude carries us forward. When you put gratitude into the world you allow for opportunities to come to you. Despite the ups and downs of life, things will ultimately work out in your favor if you believe in the gifts of the Universe.</p>
        
        <p>I found the second paragraph really interesting because I did not know that trees could be connected by fungi. I know fungus opperates through a hive mind system so I found it incredibly intriguing that they help to redistribute carbohydrates from well nourished trees to those that were lacking. The idea that trees survive through unity blends into the idea of reciprocity. Without the help of the fungal networks, the trees would not be able to survive as a unit. The impact of the fungi impacts the rest of the ecosystem because the trees proivde nutrients to neighboring animals and people. Everything is a cycle that keeps on giving. </p>
