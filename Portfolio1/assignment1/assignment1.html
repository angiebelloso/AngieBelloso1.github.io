<h1><strong>The Eras of the Internet</strong></h1>
<h2>Angie Belloso, 2023</h2>

<p>In the article “404 page not found”, Wagner introduces interesting concepts surrounding the transformation of the internet. From the ways the internet has evolved since the early 90s, leading up to Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. She mentions GeoCities and the impermanence of websites along with their content. The reality of the fact is that most websites are less than 10 years old leads me to question the importance of user experience and interaction.</p> 
    <p>Wagner mentions that Facebook was first introduced to Harvard students because of its “clean” and professional aesthetic. Websites such as Myspace, where users could customize their websites with music and gifs were reduced to being outdated and nostalgic. With the resurgence of the early 2000s aesthetic in fashion and media, the digital world is also impacted by these trends. The difference is that companies have been doing this long before the return of the Y2K era. In paragraph 2 Wagner mentions that "It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism.” Companies are appealing to nostalgia by recycling elements of web 1.0 such as the use of low-resolution glittery gifs on major platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat. This is highly appealing especially as a fellow gen z, because it reminds me of elements from my childhood such as Lisa Frank, notorious for super saturated colors. Technological cannibalism is like the cyclical trends of the fashion industry.</p>
    <p>Under the subsection of The Hell of beautiful Interfaces, Wagner states “...Web 1.0 required users to manually code, design, and manage their own spaces on the net...” The internet was a type of medium which allowed for a plethora of niche websites and communities to form. However, as the internet continues to evolve, and users learn more about hacking, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a personal and safe connection to the internet. By providing websites and apps with a generic layout, users are robbed of the potential to learn the skills needed to understand the basics of web design. This keeps the public in the dark about certain policies and the inner mechanisms to understanding technological advances. Not only that, but it allows for the privacy of users to be exploited.</p>  
    <p>Continuously, Wagner mentions that the contents of niche websites were never given importance or studied but yet the history of Helvetica has been studied. This is almost reductionist towards the users of the internet because “The genuine experiences of users are ignored, despite the fact that the internet has always been deeply and irrevocably personal”. She goes on to state that “...The users of those technologies and services can only be found in the data point...”. This quote had me wondering, what exactly is user experience (UX) then? Users are reduced to numbers rather than humans experiencing a platform. Tech companies and media platforms are not considerate or value the relationship the “user” has to their experience. 1 consequence of this is the dark web and the unregulated websites that traffic women and children.</p>
